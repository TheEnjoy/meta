title: "Billing"

We bill for the [closed](/meta/rsdp/definition-of-done) tasks only.
We bill our clients once a week. In our invoice, we include the closed tasks for the last week.

If a client is not paying us for some reason in the agreed period of time - we stop all our development process for this client until the bill is paid.

## Formula

Our billing formula is very simple.

Each task has an estimate. This estimate will never change.
Each person in the team has a rate. This rate can change, all our rate are public.

The resulting price for each task will be calculated as:

```python
task_cost = task_estimated_hours * assignee_rate
```


## Adjustments

We pay our developers as salaries only half of the money you pay us.

We spend the other half on our internal needs: paying for bugs, reviews, servers, etc.
And that's how we make money as a company. We also take a part of this money as a profit.

But this is not a secret for anyone.


## How our invoice looks like

Please, take a look at our [example invoice](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hVaCX4ALWDAYYxOlJ5m8hjwdXEBFcessYn6NUHQOujo/edit?usp=sharing).
That's exactly what our clients get every week.
